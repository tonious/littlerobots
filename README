## Firmware

Compiling the firmware requires the avr-gcc toolchain.  Installing it also requires avrdude and some manner of supported AVR programmer.

Ideally, flashing a new ATtiny microcontroller should be as simple as:

cd firmware
make
make flash
make fuse

'make flash' and 'make fuse' may require root on some computers.

cd python
./commandline.py
